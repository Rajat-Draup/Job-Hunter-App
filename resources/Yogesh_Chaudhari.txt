Projects
Project Description
Name Embedded Linux for Integrated Paint System - eLIPS
Client NOATM, SEROP
Work Location Bangalore
Duration Since Feb 2008.
Description This project evaluated the real time properties of preempt_rt linux to deploy Linux based BSP
(board support package) for use in IPS(Integrated Paint System) of ABB’s paint robots and
validate its performance in real world applications.
Team Size 4 persons
Responsibilities Porting rt-preempt linux and u-boot to the paint interface board.

Patch management.

Testing and analysis of real-time performance for rt-preempt on PIB.

Lauterbach scripts for porting boot-loader to PIB.

Developed code for multiport PTPd from the IEEE1588 specifications for precise time

synchronization.
Release manager for all incremental and final release of eLIPS.

Configuration management

Operating

Customer
Benefit
In case of propriety RTOS like vxWorks a large amount of time and money had to be invested in
terms of both development and licensing cost. Also much time was required to port ABB
applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on
single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux
while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch. This was a research
project that studied the properties of preempt_rt patched Linux in real world scenarios and
decided on worst case timings that will satisfy requirements in ABB’s robotic applications
Project Description
Name CCPU
Role Software Developer
Client NOATM
Duration July 2009
Work Location Bangalore
Description This project involved putting realtime embedded Linux on the MPC5200 based CCPU board.
The CCPU is a piggyback board and the application running on it depends on where it is
mounted. This project follows CMMi Level 5 standards.
Team Size 1 person
Responsibilities Writing a user space driver for detecting configuration of underlying board.

Open source software license compliance

Create a Install image for installing IPS on Linux BSP provided and develop, present and

merge into NOATM build system
Provide a mechanism for field upgrade of BSP provided in case of newer releases

Startup scripts to start various applications and daemons on board boot-up

To identify and perform tests to check the real-time properties of Linux kernel and

integrate them into NOATM BVT (build verification test) system using python scripts.

Customer Benifit Apart from the obvious benefits that any open source software brings, using an open source
Linux BSP allowed the customer to use a number of COTS (commercially off the shelf)
components that drastically reduced the time to marked, especially since many libraries useful
for robotics applications are readily available for Linux platforms like vision libraries, Ability to
port languages like python, perl etc which can be readily done on linux but is extremely time
consuming on other real time platforms like vxworks. Such porting does not provide any value
addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.
