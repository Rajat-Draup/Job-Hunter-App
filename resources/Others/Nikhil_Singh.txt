Experience
DATA SCIENTIST | DIET CODE APPLICATIONS PVT. LTD. | DECEMBER 2016 – PRESENT
 Recommender Engines for the news app (NewsCase)
o Content Recommender (entity recognition and jaccard coefficient)
o Collaborative Filtering (matrix factorization for implicit feedback based on libmf)
o User-user based collaborative filtering was used to understand customer behavior and to provide
recommendation which increased the number of articles read by 15%.
 Worked on financial time-series modelling data using random forest and achieved prediction accuracy
of more than 90%
 Built a system to compare performance of mlpack, libmf and spark on matrix factorization using docker
 Built A/B testing framework to validate the recommender system
 Implemented the recommender engine in production environment using docker and provided top-n
recommended articles
DATA SCIENTIST | COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS | MAY 2016 – DECEMBER 2016
 Worked on text mining manpower project to identify relevant words from job-descriptions as input to
search queries (Stemming, Parts Of Speech (POS) tagging) & built a search engine over it.
 Improved the accuracy of hitting correct job-description from 32% to 47%
 Created credit scoring model to predict delinquent customers (imputation using SMOTE, logistic
regression & Decision Tree)
 Managed a team of 5 people and completed a time-series modeling project (ARIMA) & created
visualizations using Shiny (R package) – TAPE (Ticket Analysis and Prediction Engine)
 Received Q-3 Spotlight award for being the best performer in Data Science division and for handling an
entire time-series modeling project
SOFTWARE ENGINEER | NUCLEUS SOFTWARE EXPORTS LTD. | JULY 2012 – JUNE 2014
 Project on delinquent customers module handling Big Data & completed Change Service Requests
