ERSONAL DETAILS
OBJECTIVE
Aiming to seek an opportunity to work in an organization, where I shall be able to utilize my analytical skills and
knowledge to help the organization meet its business goals while adhering to the vision, mission and values and in
turn gaining the expertise that would help me in building a strong and successful career.
SKILLS
 Basic Programming/Software: C++, Python, MySQL, MATLAB, Tableau
 Certifications: MOOCs in Machine Learning and Applied Data Science with Python
 Computer Software: MS-Word, Advanced Excel, PowerPoint
EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION
SHORT TERM COURSES
 Modeling Physical Systems and Electric Power Systems with Simscape by MathWorks held at NITTTR, Chandigarh
 Used MATLAB to support data analysis and simulation, while using a full set of statistics and machine
learning functionality, high speed processing of large data sets, data cleaning, features extraction and classification
 PCB designing workshop by RS Design Spark held at NITTTR, Chandigarh
PUBLICATIONS (CONFERENCES)
 Discrete Wavelet Packet based Elbow Movement Classification using Fine Gaussian SVM (at IEEE 1st
International
Conference on Power Electronics, Intelligent Control and Energy Systems, Delhi Technical University, July - 2016)
 Denoising, feature extraction, and classification are proposed based on Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) of surface
Electromyogram signal (sEMG) using Fine Gaussian SVM classifier to achieve accuracy of 92.8%.
 Frequency Domain (TFD) feature extraction so that the possibility of Mean Square Error (MSE) should be minimum.
 Low training time and fast speed of response, can help in achieving control of the external robotic device in future
work
 Home Automation Control System Implementation using SSVEP based Brain Computer Interface (at IEEE
International Conference on Inventive Computing and Informatics, Coimbatore, Nov- 2017)
 Feature extraction using minimum energy combination - helps in the computation of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
analogous to the LED flickering frequencies mounted on the visual panel.
 Classification of features has been done using Linear Discriminant Analysis to achieve 84.8% accuracy.
 The intended control commands (output classes) have been sent to the Arduino for controlling the home appliances.

ACADEMIC PROJECTS
 Thesis on Steady State Visual Evoked Potential based Brain Computer Interface to control the Home Appliances
 Non-Invasive Mind Machine Interface based on the SSVEP control modality for controlling the home appliances in an
offline environment.
 The Minimum Energy block: artifact removal, estimate signal to noise ratio
 The data from 10 subjects has been used to train the LDA classifier model resulted in an accuracy of 84.8%, which has
been used for validation on data of two subjects resulting in accuracy of 80.6% and 81.8% respectively.
 Automatic Auditorium Controller Project in Embedded System
 Infrared sensor on entrance and exit of door to detect people
 LCD display for estimating count of persons present in the auditorium
 Helped in automatic control reducing the manual effort to turn on/off the load
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING
 Three months Internship in “Data Science and Machine Learning”, at Zinnov Management Consulting, Bangalore, May
2018
 Six months Industrial training on “Embedded Systems Technology”, STEP, GNDEC, Ludhiana, 2015
 Autonomous robot for obstacle detection and collision avoidance
 Six weeks training of “CCNA Project on NAT” using packet tracer at NETMAX Technologies, Patiala, 2013
 Network address translation (NAT) saves public IP addresses. Because a client only needs a public IP address when
it is communicating with the Internet, the pool of globally routable IP addresses can be shared with other clients
